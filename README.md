# reimagined-design-patterns

Give a summary description of Four design patterns that you choose from the following design patterns: **Adapter,  Builder, Composite, Decorator, Observer, Interpreter, State, Mediator, Memento, Prototype, Proxy**. In your summaries say:

- what kind of problem(s) you can solve with that pattern and when you use it, maybe with a short example
- how the pattern works, what the basic idea of the pattern is
- what the main advantage and what the the main disadvantage is of using this pattern
- Write a short summary for each of the four patterns, about half a page for each pattern (rather less than more). 

> Do not add diagrams, and do not try to give a complete description of the patterns as found in the books. Rather think of how you would explain the essential ideas of these patterns in a few sentences to a colleague while drinking coffee.

**Builder Pattern:**
Builder Pattern is to create the complex code with step by step. Builder pattern used for Large and Complex development. Advantage is Step by step creation, so bugs can identify early stage and easy to seperate the code. Disadvantage is big code.

**State Patterm:**
State Pattern used for change the internal states from one to another states. State Pattern will reduce the dependency between the state changes from one to another. State pattern have the knowledge about pre states as well as post states.

**Observer:**
Observer pattern observes the event or any action happen to the code and notify those event or action to the mutiple objects. Observer pattern used to collect the data from outside environment and also share the those changes to others as a notification.
